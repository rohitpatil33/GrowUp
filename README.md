# 📈 GrowwUp – Virtual Stock Market Simulator

**GrowwUp** is a real-time, beginner-friendly virtual stock trading simulator that allows users to understand the basics of the stock market without any financial risk. Designed as an experiential platform, it uses live NSE stock data, simulates buying/selling behavior, and provides portfolio tracking with personalized analysis.
